        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Traditional Italian limoncello is typically of the Amalfi coast, a beautiful area around Naples. It's traditionally made with Sorento lemons, which are large and flavorful and a really unique Italian product.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 lemons</li>
            <li>1 quart 95% alcohol (190 proof)</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>4 cups white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Zest lemons, making sure to get the outermost part of the skin and avoid the white pith.</li>
            <li>Place lemon zest in a glass bowl and cover with alcohol. Cover and let infuse at room temperature until yellowish in color, about 7 days.</li>
            <li>Bring water and sugar to the boil in a saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove syrup from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour alcohol into the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer; discard lemon zest. Stir well.</li>
            <li>Pour limoncello into thick, freezer-safe glass bottles. Store in the freezer for at least 2 weeks before serving.</li>
        </ol>
